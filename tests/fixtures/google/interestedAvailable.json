From preliminary analysis, the root cause of the issue was caused by a new infrastructure feature triggering a latent issue within internal network load balancer code.\n**Customer Impact:**\n* Google Groups - Affected customers in Europe were unable to access web and mobile clients.\n* Google Calendar and Tasks - Affected customers in Europe were unable to access web mobile clients.\n* Google Chat - Affected customers in Europe were unable to access web and mobile clients.\n* Google Gmail - Affected customers in Europe were unable to access web and mobile clients.\n**Additional details:**\nThe error was caught within 4 minutes by automated safety systems, and further spread was slowed at this point. The issue was fully mitigated approximately 1hr 44m later, when our engineering team completed a rollout to disable the vulnerable code path.
